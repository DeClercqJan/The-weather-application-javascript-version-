- Repository: weather-app
- Type of Challenge: Learning Challenge
- Duration: 2 and half days
- Deployment strategy : Github page
- Team challenge : group of two


## Sprint 1

- Create an account on [openweather map](https://home.openweathermap.org/.), a website that has weather data from different countries
- To use it ,you are going to have to generate a key. This key is personal to each account created.
- Create a home page where you ask the visitor to enter the city of his choice.

## Sprint 2

- Get the weather data using axios / fetch / xmlhttprequest. Choose what you prefer.
(- Use a cdn link to link axios to your project)
- Display the weather for the next 5 days.
- There are multiple methods (GET/POST...)
- Apply styling to your project using media queries to make it responsive.

## Bonus
- Display other data from the open weathermap API.
- Create icon for each state ("cloud" , "sun", "rain").
- Use an external api to display the picture of the city of your choice 

## Modality
Readme files are really important on github so i want you to write few lines that describe your project.
